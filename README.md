## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/GOLLAPUDI-PRIYANKA/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction

2.Install dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Download the Titanic dataset (if not included) and place it in the data/ folder.

Run the notebook:

Open notebooks/titanic_xgboost.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

About
The model achieves around 82-83% accuracy using XGBoost with tuned hyperparameters and carefully engineered features. This repository is intended for learning and experimentation with real-world machine learning workflows.
